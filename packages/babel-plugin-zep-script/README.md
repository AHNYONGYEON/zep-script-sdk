# babel-plugin-zep-script

Babel plugin for ZEP Script TypeScript development.

```js
module.exports = {
  // ...
  plugins: [
    // ...
    'zep-script',
  ],
};
```

NOTE: This plugin is intended to use with boilerplate generated by [zep-script-cli](). If you are developing ZEP App without TypeScript and [zep-script]() package, you don't need to use this plugin.
